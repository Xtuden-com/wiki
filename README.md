# Wiki App

This is an integration of pico-cms in ownCloud.

## Description

Idea is to use a flatfile cms like PicoCMS, and integrate this with ownCloud.
You can edit the content of a public site via markdown files in ownCloud.
The functional set of markdown provides a wiki-like page.

The admin group has access to configurations, content and layout folders.
- The content folder can be shared with a group of editors via ownCloud.
- The layout of the page can be shared with a group of front end developers.

The wiki page is availabe under an app route
- access with/without authentication optional
- a subdomain or custom path can be configured for the page (apache config)

## Use cases
- company wiki for a basic knowledge base
- help pages for ownCloud usage and faq
- very easy website development environment

## Stauts
The development status for the wiki app is a prototype.
